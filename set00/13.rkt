; (make-point true false) will return (make-point true false) as a visual representation
; The call doesn't actually create a point because we have not assigned it to a variable.
;
; (point-x (make-point true false)) returns true, as expected.
; make-point assigns true to x and false to y, then the point-x function reads what point is assigned to x of the point.
